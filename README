To build the RTX, extract the tarball, cd to the RTOS directory and run:

'make'

This will produce three executable binaries, 'myRTX', 'KB' and 'CRT', which correspond to the RTX system, the UNIX keyboard helper and UNIX CRT helper systems respectively.
To run the RTX, run:

'./myRTX'

To run the automated unit tests bundled with the source, run:

'make tests'

To enable output logging and debugging output, type:

'make DEBUG=1'

To generate the Doxygen documentation, type:

'make docs'

As of 10/24/09, the automated unit tests consist of queue interface tests and a valgrind memcheck run.

Contributions:
==============
This software was written by Syed S. Albiz. The sparc stack pointer setting routine in the file set.s was taken
from freely distributed code from the course project page (I have been unable to find the license,
if any, that this code is distributed under).
